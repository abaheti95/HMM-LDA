# HMM-LDA-CPP
"Integrating Topics and Syntax" T.L. Griffiths et al. C++ implementation of HMM-LDA. Inspired by katsuya94/hmm-lda

The code is not tested on real data (yet), but should work as expected.

### TODO:
 - Add some scripts that emits the top k words from each topic and various other important counts based on the files in the results folder.
